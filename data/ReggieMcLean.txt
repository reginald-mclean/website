Reginald McLean (Reggie) is a PhD Candidate at Toronto Metroplitan University. Reggie's research interests lie at the intersection of multi-task reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and representation learning. My PhD research is focused on enabling a more effective transfer of skills in multi-task reinforcement learning agents. Within this current research I have begun to investigate how to learn a single policy to control multiple environments each with their own dynamics model, and how reward functions interact during actor-critic training. More generally I am interested in how current machine learning methods can enable more effective learning for reinforcement learning agents. These methods range from using vision-language models for modeling dense reward functions, to leveraging generative models for creating diverse reinforcement learning environments and the tasks within them. I believe that the next iteration of reinforcement learning agents will need to be able to accomplish multiple tasks, while also being able to quickly adapt to new tasks. Each of these research projects take a step in that direction.
